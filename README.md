# Set Max Players

Adds the ability to set the maximum player limit while the server is online, without requring a restart!

You will need 1.20 or higher to use this plugin (due to API limitations), and plugins like PlugManX are compatible to hot load this plugin if you needed to.

Run the command /setmaxplayers (amount) to set the maximum players to whatever you want!
